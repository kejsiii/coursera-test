	<h1>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h1>
	<h2>Subheading</h2>
	<p>As you could see, our h1 tag is in the middle of the screen, and it's green. And the two paragraphs that we have are blue and only take up around 200 pixels. And already, right away, you could see the power of CSS. We only specified the paragraph tagged once, and yet every paragraph in the document is styled exactly the same. So, it affords us consistency and also efficiency is writing CSS code. Now, I do want to point out one quick but important thing. If you take a look at this subheading 1, and then subheading 2, you can see that it is bold and it's a little bit bigger than the regular text would be. Now, where did that style come from? I certainly never specified what kind of styling to apply to, essentially, what is an h2 tag. Well, that styling came from the browser itself. Every browser comes with some default styles that it applies to different HTML elements. And h1, h2, and so on, and different other elements are very commonly styled by the browser itself. So, a lot of the times it's your job to really reset, or override, these styles and put the styles in that you would like your webpage to have. So, to summarize, we went over the syntax of a CSS rule. </p>
